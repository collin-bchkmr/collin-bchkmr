# About me
Hi! I'm 17 years old and from Germany. I'm currently trying to find a project to rewrite in another language to get better at coding.<br />
I will start working as a IT-specialist for application development on the 1st September 2023.<br />
I'm also looking for some collaborations. Feel free to add me on Discord!<br />

My hobbies are:
- Wrestling
- Gaming
